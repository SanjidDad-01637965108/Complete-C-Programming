  <li>float (Real Numbers with Floating-Point)</li>
  <li>char (Character)</li>
  <li>void (Nothing or Null)</li>
 </ol>
 <p>In C Programming keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler. Keywords are part of the syntax and they cannot be used as an identifier.
