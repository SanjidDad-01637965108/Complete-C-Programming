# Complete C Programming

 <p><b>Q.1 What is Compiler?</b></p>
 <p><b>Ans:</b> A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language. In C programming we use <b>MinGW</b> compiler for compile our code.</p>
 <p><b>Q.2 What is C Programming?</b></p>
 <p><b>Ans:</b> The C programming language is a procedural and general-purpose language that provides low-level access in our system memory. By this language we can easily access or manipulate to the memory.</p>
 <p><b>Q.3 What is Data-Type and Keyword In C Programming?</b></p>
 <p><b>Ans:</b> In C programming, data types are declarations for variables and functions. This determines the type and size of data associated with variables and functions.</p>
 <p>Basic Data-Types:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>int (Integer)</li>
  <li>double (Real Numbers with Floating-Point)</li>
  <li>float (Real Numbers with Floating-Point)</li>
  <li>char (Character)</li>
  <li>void (Nothing or Null)</li>
 </ol>
 <p>In C Programming keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler. Keywords are part of the syntax, and they cannot be used as an identifier. As C is a case-sensitive language, all keywords must be written in lowercase. There are 32 Keywords in C Programming.</p>
 <p><b>Q.4 What is Operator In C Programming?</b></p>
 <p><b>Ans:</b> An operator is a symbol that operates on a value or a variable. C has a wide range of operators to perform various operations.</p>
 <p>Basic Operator:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %)</li>
  <li>Increment and Decrement Operators (++, --)</li>
  <li>Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)</li>
  <li>Relational Operators (==, <, >, <=, >=, !=)</li>
  <li>Logical Operators (||, &&, !)</li>
 </ol>
 <p><b>Q.5 What is Escape Sequence Character In C Programming?</b></p>
 <p><b>Ans:</b> The escape sequence in C is the characters or the sequence of characters that can be used inside the string literal. The purpose of the escape sequence is to represent a spacial meaning. The character can not interface the code. The character used normally using the keyboard.</p>
 <p>Escape Sequence Character:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>\ a (Alarm or Beep)</li>
  <li>\ b (Backspace)</li>
  <li>\ n (New Line)</li>
  <li>\ t (Horizontal Tab)</li>
  <li>\ ' (Single Quote)</li>
  <li>\ 0 (Null Char)</li>
 </ol>
 <p><b>Q.6 What is Format Specifier In C Programming?</b></p>
 <p><b>Ans:</b> The format specifier in C is used to tell the compiler about the type of data to be printed or scanned in input and output operations. They always start with a % symbol and are used in the formatted string in functions.</p>
 <p>Basic Format Specifier:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>% d (For Integer)</li>
  <li>% f (For Float)</li>
  <li>% lf (For Double)</li>
  <li>% c (For Character)</li>
  <li>% s (For String)</li>
  <li>% p (For Pointer)</li>
  <li>% u (For Unsigned Integer)</li>
 </ol>
 <p><b>Q.7 What is IF…ELSE Statement In C Programming?</b></p>
 <p><b>Ans:</b> In Programming if/else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the test expression is evaluated to true, statements inside the body of if are executed. If the test expression is evaluated to false, statements inside the body of if are not executed.</p>
 <p><b>Q.8 What is Nested IF…ELSE In C Programming?</b></p>
 <p><b>Ans:</b> In Programming nested if/else means statement inside the body of another if...else statement.</p>
